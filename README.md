Hi! These are the resources used in my animation series in YouTube, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYhKafXeatAPYt1ZJU60AsAuN6xXb9NFE

They're licensed under an MIT license, so you're free to use these in any project, personal or commercial, I hope they help you out!
